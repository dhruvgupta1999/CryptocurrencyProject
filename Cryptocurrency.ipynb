    "The Bitcoin system orders transactions by placing them in groups\n",
    "called blocks and then linking these blocks through what is called Blockchain. \n",
    "`The transactions in one block are considered to have happened at the same time.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The fingerprint, called a hash, takes a lot of computing time and energy to generate initially(This time and energy increases or decreases depending upon the total computing power present with the miners). It thus serves as a proof that the miner who added the block to the blockchain did the computational work to earn a bitcoin reward (for this reason, Bitcoin is said to use a “proof-of-work” protocol). This hash is just a merkle hash of all the transactions included in this block. It also serves as a kind of seal, since altering the block would require generating a new hash. Verifying whether or not the hash matches its block, however, is easy, and once the nodes have done so they update their respective copies of the blockchain with the new block. This is the consensus protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final security element is that the hashes also serve as the links in the blockchain: each block includes the previous block’s unique hash. So if you want to change an entry in the ledger retroactively, you have to calculate a new hash not only for the block it’s in but also for every subsequent block. And you have to do this faster than the other nodes can add new blocks to the chain (On an average a new block is added every 10 minutes). So unless you have computers that are more powerful than the rest of the nodes combined (and even then, success isn’t guaranteed), all the alterations needs to be done in 10 minutes window, any blocks you add will conflict with existing ones, and the other nodes will automatically reject your alterations. This is what makes the blockchain tamperproof, or “immutable.”"
